# Analysis of Needs
## Introduction
For my internship at Witteveen + Bos, I'm developing an application to enable users to provide feedback on 3D building or other objects, enhancing interaction and modernizing the experience. Currently, users can only respond on a 2D map, limiting the specificity of feedback. Transitioning to a 3D environment offers the potential for more precise feedback by visualizing structures in three dimensions.

The project primarily targets two stakeholder groups: governmental bodies, Witteveen + Bos, and other engineering advisory firms, along with their diverse clientele. By receiving feedback from these groups, the aim is to improve engagement with the 3D mapping interface compared to traditional 2D maps.

The overarching objective is to gain insights into the requirements and constraints of the project through a thorough analysis of needs. Anticipated challenges include aligning the envisioned functionalities with the capabilities of the ArcGIS application.

This initiative not only seeks to enhance user experience but also holds the potential to reshape stakeholder interaction with spatial data in urban planning and development contexts.
