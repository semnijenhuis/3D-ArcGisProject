# Introduction
For my internship at Witteveen + Bos, I'm developing an application to enable users to provide feedback on 3D building or other objects, enhancing interaction and modernizing the experience. 

Currently, users are confined to offering feedback solely within a 2D map interface, which inherently limits the specificity and depth of their input. By transitioning to a 3D environment, we envision unlocking the potential for more nuanced and precise feedback. Visualizing structures in three dimensions not only enriches the user experience but also provides a more comprehensive understanding of the architectural landscape.
In the preceding document, the Analysis of Needs, we explored the overarching requirements, risks, and aspirations for the project on a broad scale. Now, in the Requirements Analysis phase, our focus shifts towards a more in depth examination of the details necessary for project realization.

# Scope definition
The primary objective of this project is to enable users to provide feedback on 3D buildings or objects interactively. The application will leverage React.js and JavaScript for frontend development, while utilizing the ArcGIS Web API for mapping functionalities.

Key deliverables include comprehensive developer manuals for Witteveen + Bos developers and product owners. These manuals will provide detailed instructions on implementing and customizing the application according to specific project requirements.

End users will have the capability to provide feedback anywhere on the 3D model, view existing responses, and interact with the building in a three-dimensional environment.

Project owners will have limited customization options, primarily focusing on ease of implementation and usability. While they won't be able to modify the building itself, they will have access to essential functionalities for managing user responses and interactions.

The project's dependency on the ArcGIS API necessitates alignment with their functionalities, with consideration for potential changes or removals in the API's features.

Stakeholders anticipate a novel approach to user participation, presenting both exciting opportunities and challenges for the project's success.

Potential risks include limitations imposed by the ArcGIS platform, which may require adjustments to meet project requirements effectively.

The project's success will be determined by the ability of users to seamlessly place responses in 3D space on or within a building, ensuring accessibility and usability for a wide range of users.

# External interfaces
## ArcGIS WebScene Integration
Inbeeld 3D will rely mostly on ArcGis WebScene for the rendering of the buildings/ objects in 3D. The ArcGis JavaScript API interacts with WebScene and SceneView components so that it can visualize a building in 3D.

## Data Exchange with ArcGIS
For all responses the application is connected to our database that is already build for the 2D map, it will adjust some minor details to make it compatible with the extra data needed. But it will all be RESTful APIs with Django.

## SceneView Configuration
SceneView is the backbone of displaying immersive 3D scenes (buildings/ objects). With customizing the SceneView your able to change specific settings such as the camera position, lighting effects and layers so we can enhance the user experience.

## Performance Optimization
To optimize performance when interacting with ArcGIS services, we are going to use different strategies such as data caching, lazy loading of resources, asynchronous data fetching and changing which objects needs to be render. This way we try to improve the responsiveness of our application.

## Error Handling and Recovery
Our application will include error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions and recover from failures when a user tries different things than expected. 

## Privacy Considerations
We are going to store only the data that we are allowed to store with GDPR and other ruling

## Integration Testing
We conduct testing with cypress to verify the seamless interaction between our application and ArcGIS services. These testing scenarios include validating data exchange and simulating various error conditions to ensure robustness and reliability.
